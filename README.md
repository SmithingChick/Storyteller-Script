# Storyteller-Script
A small storytelling javascript, with an impressive number of nouns.

My first serious Javascript project, from a project on the Treehouse basic Javascript class.  Apparently, the story didn't need to be quite this long or involved-- the example the instructor gave at the end was only one or two sentences. But I like to write stories, so I wrote.
